You truly do feel like a local when staying with Daniele!!\\r\\n',\n",

The room we stayed in was lovely and comfortable, and he provided us with a hair dryer, towels, tea and coffee, maps and guide books. He was a wealth of information in terms of when to go to certain museums, what was and wasn't worthwhile, and the best ways to get around using public transportation. He even allowed us to use his bikes free of charge! He was very accommodating and accepted our booking very last minute, and didn't mind that we were arriving late in the evening on a weeknight. The location of his apartment is also great--near both train and bus stops, in a nice, quiet neighborhood. I would absolutely recommend staying here! \",\n",

Tons of leaflets, magazines and print-outs about things to do in Amsterdam (plus bus routes and timetables) can be found in the room and in the hall of the apartment. The house is extremely clean. There are bus and tram stops nearby, which make it easy to get around the city. I would not hesitate to recommend Daniel to other people that want to stay in Amsterdam.',\n",

We were also provided with clean towels. Daniel's place also has easy public transport to get around. Daniel was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Highly recommended.\",\n",
       " 'It was a very pleasant stay, Daniel is very nice and helpful, he provides all info a visitor may need. The location is very convenient too, close to bus, train station and very easy to get around. I loved my visit in Amsterdam, will definitely come back again!!',\n",

We were looking for a relaxing stay so we mostly kept to ourselves and he seemed to respect that as well but I got the idea that he would have been very sociable if that is the kind of stay you are interested in.',\n",
       " \"We had the most wonderful experience at Daniel's place in Amsterdam! Not only was the room comfortable, colourful, light, quiet, and equipped with everything we could possibly need - and Daniel's flat spotless and beautifully furnished and in a great location - but Daniel himself is the perfect host, spending the first hour of our arrival talking to us about Amsterdam, answering our many questions, showing us how to get around. We felt immediately comfortable and welcomed, and confident that, during our three day visit, if we had any questions, Daniel would be there to help us. Indeed, on our first day, he emailed to check we were okay! We can't recommend Daniel highly enough!\",\n",

Great recommendations for food and drink.  He has a spotless home and the room is very comfortable with everything you need. Super host indeed!',\n",

A 15-minute tram ride will get you to the city center no problem, though. Daniel also makes it very easy to understand how to get around as well. It is clear Daniel has thought everything through when it comes to accommodations, and if you like a quieter, more residential neighborhood, I would suggest staying here. ',\n",

His apartment is in amazing location, very easily accessible by tram or bus, 15min from the Centraal Station. \\nTo say that the apartment was super clean is an understatement, we have very high standards but would give extra stars for cleanliness if I could.']"
